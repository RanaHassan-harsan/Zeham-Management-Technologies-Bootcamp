        "## Dataset Overview\n",
        "The dataset contains information about traffic accidents, including location, weather conditions, road conditions, and more. Below are sample of these columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Location_Easting_OSGR`: Easting coordinate of the accident location.\n",
        "* `Location_Northing_OSGR`: Northing coordinate of the accident location.\n",
        "* `Longitude`: Longitude of the accident site.\n",
        "* `Latitude`: Latitude of the accident site.\n",
        "* `Police_Force`: Identifier for the police force involved.\n",
        "* `Accident_Severity`: Severity of the accident.\n",
        "* `Number_of_Vehicles`: Number of vehicles involved in the accident.\n",
        "* `Number_of_Casualties`: Number of casualties in the accident.\n",
        "* `Date`: Date of the accident.\n",
        "* `Day_of_Week`: Day of the week when the accident occurred.\n",
